                    Document Locking: This feature enables the automatic locking of documents once they have been sent
                    for approval or have received approval from at least one approver. This ensures data integrity and
                    compliance by preventing changes during the approval process.

                Once the module is installed, you will notice a new menu item called "Approval Settings" that will be
                added. In this view, you will find a comprehensive summary displaying the number of predefined approval
                roles and the total count of created approval routes.

            </p>
            <p>
                After installing the module you will be able to enable dynamic approval workflow for your
                customer and vendor payments:
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="oe_screenshot" src="settings_payments.png"
                     alt="Approval Workflow Settings for Payments" width="100%"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the interface provides convenient quick action buttons to facilitate the process of adding
                new approval roles or routes. This allows you to easily expand the approval functionality according to
                your specific requirements.
            </p>

            <h2>Predefined Approval Roles</h2>
            <p>
                "Predefined Approval Roles" allow you to designate specific employees as persistent approvers for
                various documents, such as Purchase Orders, Sale Orders, Expense Reports, Payments and more.
                With this feature, you can easily set up predefined roles, ensuring that certain individuals
                consistently handle approvals for specific document types.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="oe_screenshot" src="predefined_approval_roles.png" alt="Predefined Approval Roles"
                     width="100%"/>
            </p>

            <h2>Creating Approval Role</h2>
            <p>
                To add a new role, you need to enter the role's name, select one or multiple users, and choose the
                company for which this role is relevant.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="oe_screenshot" src="predefined_approval_role_form.png" alt="Predefined Approval Role Form"
                     width="100%"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                If multiple users are specified, the document can be approved by any of them, or the system will request
                approval from all specified users, depending on the approval cycle settings. Selecting a company will
                allow you to create identical roles if you have multiple companies set up and you are using the "Multi
                Company" functionality.
            </p>

            <h2>Creating Approval Route</h2>
            <p>
                The creation of approval routes enables the establishment of flexible and dynamic rules to generate a
                list of users who must sequentially approve a document for it to be considered fully approved.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this module, you can add an unlimited number of stages, each with multiple custom conditions. To
                include a user in the approval cycle, the system can evaluate factors such as the document's total
                amount, the selected partner, company, country, or specific products and analytical accounts used.
                Another noteworthy feature of the module is the ability to specify custom conditions using Python code
                to add an approver to the approval cycle.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row example">
        <div class="col-12">
            <p>
                Here is some example of payment approval route:
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 3 stages in this payment approval route.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="oe_screenshot" src="payment_approval_route_demo.png"
                     alt="Payments Approval Route Example"
                     width="100%"/>
            </p>
            <p>Each person will be requested to approve payments based on specific conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Financial Analyst</strong>: The Financial Analyst should approve payments with
                    a total amount equal to or greater than 500 USD.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Partner Relationship Manager</strong>: The Relationship Manager should approve payments
                    if they are associated with specific partner (Azure Interior in that case).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Chief Accountant</strong>: The Chief Accountant will be requested to approve payment with
                    a total amount equal to or greater than 5000 USD.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As you have noticed, the conditions are highly flexible, allowing for the coverage of various business
                requirements for the approval system. Additionally, this is not an exhaustive list of conditions; the
                route generation can be further customized based on various criteria as needed.
            </p>
            <h2>Selective Field Locking</h2>
            <p>
                The Selective Field Locking functionality allows users to designate specific document fields that will
                remain locked for changes after the document has been sent for approval or has received approval from at
                least one participant.
            </p>
            <h2>Creating Dynamic Payment Approval Workflow</h2>
            <p>To create a new payments approval workflow, follow these steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter a name for the workflow.</li>
                <li>Select the data model for which this workflow will be applied.</li>
                <li>Specify the users responsible for managing and keeping this workflow up-to-date.</li>
                <li>Add approval stages</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Adding Payment Approval Stage</h2>
            <p>To add a new stage you need to click "Add New Stage".</p>
            <p>Here is how the form looks like:</p>
            <p>
                <img class="oe_screenshot" src="approval_stage_form_conditions.png"
                     alt="Dynamic Payment Approval Stage Conditions"
                     width="100%"/>
            </p>
            <h4>Stage Title</h4>
            <p>Name for payment approval stage</p>
            <h4>Approval Type</h4>
            <p>There are two options available: "At least one approver" and "All approvers."</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "At least one approver" implies that approval from a minimum of one person is sufficient to consider
                    the approval stage as completed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    "All approvers" requires that the document must receive approval from all approvers assigned to the
                    approval stage for it to be considered fully approved.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Approvers (Predefined)</h4>
            <p>Here a predefined approval role can be selected.</p>
            <h4>Approvers (Custom)</h4>
            <p>
                This field is to specify custom approvers for the stage. If there is no predefined role, you can select
                any user as approver. Please do not forget to grant user access to the associated module. Also, here you
                can select multiple users.
            </p>
            <p>
                The option to select multiple users who can approve a document offers several advantages in managing the
                payments approval process:
            </p>
            <p>
                Vacation or Leave Coverage: If one of the designated approvers is on vacation or leave, another
                authorized approver from the selected group can handle the approval. This ensures that the payment
                approval process remains uninterrupted even in the absence of certain users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shared Responsibility: By spreading the responsibility among multiple employees, the burden of approvals
                can be distributed more evenly. This not only helps prevent bottlenecks but also promotes a more
                efficient and timely approval workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having this feature in place adds flexibility and resilience to the payment approval system,
                contributing to smoother operations and improved collaboration within the organization.
            </p>
            <h4>Amount</h4>
            <p>
                In this settings group, you can choose the field containing the monetary amount and specify the
                condition under which an approval stage will be added to the document.
            </p>
            <h4>Partners</h4>
            <p>
                Here, you can choose the field containing partner and select partners and specify a condition for adding
                an approval stage to the document based on whether it is associated with, or not associated with, the
                chosen partners.
            </p>
            <h4>Countries</h4>
            <p>
                Here, you can choose the field containing country and select countries and specify a condition for
                adding an approval stage to the document based on whether it is associated with, or not associated with,
                the chosen countries.
            </p>
            <h4>Companies</h4>
            <p>
                Here, you can choose the field containing company and select companies and specify a condition for
                adding an approval stage to the document based on whether it is associated with, or not associated with,
                the chosen companies
            </p>
            <h4>Products</h4>
            <p>
                That group of settings is to choose the field containing product(s) and select products and specify a
                condition for adding an approval stage to the document based on whether it is associated with, or not
                associated with, the chosen products.
            </p>
            <h4>Analytic Accounts</h4>
            <p>
                That group of settings is to choose the field containing analytic account(s) and select accounts and
                specify a condition for adding an approval stage to the document based on whether it is associated with,
                or not associated with, the chosen accounts
            </p>
            <h4>Custom Condition Code</h4>
            <p>
                You have the option to enter a Python expression to define a custom condition for including or excluding
                an approver from payment approval workflows. This allows for greater flexibility and customization
                in the approval process based on specific business requirements.

                an outgoing email server should be configured.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) supports SRS (Sender Rewriting Scheme), your users can send and
                receive notification.
                However, that is more complex and requires more technical knowledge.
            </p>

                Instead, you can install additional module to
                <a href="https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/18.0/xf_replace_email_params/">
                    Replace "Email From" and "Reply To" parameters
                </a>
                of outgoing emails.
